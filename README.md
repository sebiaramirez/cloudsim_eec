## CS378 Cloud Scheduler Project - Sebastian Ramirez
This fork of the Cloud Scheduler Project implements a customized Greedy algorithm based on the pseudocode presented in class.
Scheduler.cpp contains the algorithm and is already made and up to date. There are no changes to the makefile, and the structure is otherwise the same.
GentlerHour.md was used for testing purposes and submission.
